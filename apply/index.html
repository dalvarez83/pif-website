        <p class="font-body-lg">For candidates selected to interview, here’s our process. You will receive confirmation of your application. We are not able to provide updates on the status of your application until all fellows have been selected.</p>
        <ul class="usa-list--unstyled">
          <li>
            <p><strong>First round interviews</strong> include three conversations: skills (your area of expertise), core competencies (behavioral questions, leadership, and navigating ambiguity), and core values (including diversity, equity, and inclusion).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Second round (and final) interviews</strong> are with PIF’s federal agency partner(s). This is a conversation with the agency’s PIF project champion. The PIF team will share finalist resumes with agencies who then identify candidates that they would like to interview.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Format:</strong> All interviews occur virtually and are typically scheduled for an hour in length. We offer live captioning or other accessibility assistance to all candidates. If you are selected to interview, a member of our Talent Team will be in touch to ensure we’ll have any accessibility considerations covered.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Offer Process:</strong> Once the agency interviews are complete, the PIF team will meet with each agency to discuss their selections. This gives us our list of finalists to whom we make offers! We operate within the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), and the GSA HR team will then make tentative offers to selected candidates. The PIF team will also set up calls with each incoming PIF to welcome them into our program and community, and answer any questions!</p>
