            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> If you are selected to interview, a member of our Talent Team will be in touch to ensure we’ll have any accessibility considerations covered. We typically conduct interviews as video calls, however, we realize that this option may not accommodate everyone’s needs. Throughout the hiring process, please don’t hesitate to let us know if you have a preferred method of communication and we will work with you to create a positive experience. If you require accommodations, please contact us directly at jointts@gsa.gov or 773-970-7945.</p>

            <p><strong>PIF interviews</strong> begin with skills (your area of expertise), and candidates may progress to core competencies (behavioral questions, leadership, and/or navigating ambiguity) and core values (including diversity, equity, and inclusion).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Agency interviews</strong> are with PIF’s federal agency partner(s). This is a conversation with the agency’s PIF project champion. The PIF team will share finalist resumes with agencies who then identify candidates that they would like to interview.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Format:</strong> All interviews occur virtually and are typically scheduled for an hour in length. We offer live captioning or other accessibility assistance to all candidates.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Offer process:</strong> Once the agency interviews are complete, the PIF team will meet with each agency to discuss their selections. This gives us our list of finalists to whom we make offers! We operate within the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), and the GSA HR team will then make tentative offers to selected candidates. Once the candidate accepts the tentative offer, our <a href="https://join.tts.gsa.gov/hiring-process/#security-and-onboarding" target="_blank">pre-employment process</a> begins. The PIF team will also set up calls with each incoming PIF to welcome them into our program and community, and answer any questions!</p>
